# Detailed Report – Task 6 

## Password Creation and Testing

### Password 1: Ritik123
- Length: 8 characters
- Composition: Uppercase + lowercase + numbers, no symbols
- Strength Score: 26% (Weak)
- Time to Crack: Seconds
- Feedback: Too short, predictable pattern, no special characters.

### Password 2: R!tikRaj2024
- Length: 12 characters
- Composition: Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbols
- Strength Score: 82% (Strong)
- Time to Crack: Months
- Feedback: Strong but could be longer, avoid personal names.

### Password 3: S@fe&Unbr3@k@bleP@ss!
- Length: 22 characters
- Composition: Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + multiple symbols
- Strength Score: 100% (Very Strong)
- Time to Crack: Centuries
- Feedback: Excellent length, complexity, and unpredictability.

## Best Practices Learned
- Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack.
- Mix character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words and personal information.
- Use passphrases for memorability and security.
- Unique passwords for every account.
- Use a password manager.

## Common Password Attacks
- Brute Force: Tries every possible combination.
- Dictionary: Uses common words/passwords.
- Credential Stuffing: Uses breached credentials.
- Phishing: Tricks users into revealing passwords.

## Why Length & Complexity Matter
Length increases the total number of possible combinations.
Complexity makes guessing harder. Together, they provide maximum resistance to attacks.

## Interview Questions & Answers

1. **What makes a password strong?**
A strong password is one that is difficult for both humans and machines to guess. This is achieved by making it long (at least 12 characters), using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding personal information or predictable patterns. Randomness and uniqueness are also key — the more unpredictable a password is, the stronger it becomes.
2. **What are common password attacks?**
The most common attacks are brute force, dictionary attacks, credential stuffing, and phishing. Brute force tries every possible combination, dictionary attacks use known word lists, credential stuffing uses leaked credentials from breaches, and phishing tricks users into revealing their passwords.
3. **Why is password length important?**
Password length greatly affects how long it would take an attacker to crack it. Every additional character exponentially increases the number of possible combinations, making brute force attacks significantly slower.
4. **What is a dictionary attack?**
A dictionary attack uses a predefined list of words and commonly used passwords to guess the password. It is faster than brute force because it focuses on likely options rather than testing every possible combination.
5. **What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?**
MFA is a security method that requires more than one verification step to log in. This usually combines something you know (password) with something you have (OTP, authentication app) or something you are (biometric).

6. **How do password managers help?**
Password managers securely store all your passwords in an encrypted vault and can generate strong, random passwords for new accounts. This eliminates the need to remember multiple complex passwords.

7. **What are passphrases?**
Passphrases are long strings of words combined together, often with added numbers and symbols. They are easier to remember than random character strings but can still be very secure if chosen correctly and made long enough. 
8. **What are common mistakes in password creation?**
Common mistakes include using short passwords, personal information, predictable sequences like "1234" or "abcd", common words, and reusing the same password for multiple accounts.
